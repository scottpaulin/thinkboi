# Organize Musings

This skill organizes raw voice notes from the Musings page into themed sub-pages within the user's Notion workspace.

## Organization Structure

Create sub-pages under the main Musings page, organized by theme. Themes should emerge from the content rather than being predefined. Examples of themes might include:

- Leadership
- Technology
- Personal Growth
- Industry Observations
- Ideas to Explore

Each theme sub-page collects related musings together, making it easier to find connections and develop follow-up content.

## Sub-page Format

When creating a sub-page for a theme, use this structure:

### Page Title
Use the theme name as the page title (e.g., "Leadership")

### Musing Entries
For each musing added to the theme page, include:

1. **Summary**: A one-line summary of the core idea
2. **Original Text**: The full raw musing, preserved as captured
3. **Date Added**: When the musing was organized
4. **Status**: One of the following
   - Raw: Unprocessed, as captured
   - Clarified: Worked through with follow-up questions
   - Ready to Post: Structured and ready for publication
   - Posted: Already shared
5. **Follow-up Potential**: Flag musings that could become interesting posts or warrant deeper exploration

## Instructions

1. Use the Notion MCP to read all content from the Musings page
2. Analyze each musing to identify its primary theme
3. Check if a sub-page for that theme already exists under Musings
4. If not, create a new sub-page for the theme
5. Add the musing to the appropriate theme sub-page with the format above
6. If a musing spans multiple themes, place it in the most relevant one and note the related themes
7. After organizing, summarize what was processed and highlight any musings with strong follow-up potential

## Handling Ambiguity

- If a musing does not fit any clear theme, create an "Uncategorized" sub-page
- If themes are too granular, consolidate into broader categories
- Prioritize usefulness over strict categorization

## Searchability

The one-line summary for each musing is key for searchability. Write summaries that capture the core idea in plain language so users can scan and find relevant thoughts quickly.
