# Read Musings

This skill reads raw voice notes from the "Musings" page in Notion.

## How to Find the Musings Page

Use the Notion MCP to search for a page called "Musings" in the connected workspace. This page contains voice-recorded notes captured via transcription.

## Understanding the Content Structure

The Musings page contains voice-recorded notes that have been transcribed. When reading the content, keep the following in mind:

- A single voice recording may span multiple paragraphs
- Multiple consecutive paragraphs may be part of the same thought or recording session
- The content is intentionally unfiltered and raw
- Ideas may be incomplete, loosely connected, or stream-of-consciousness in nature

## Instructions

1. Use the Notion MCP to locate the Musings page
2. Read the content from the page
3. Present the notes to the user, preserving the original structure
4. When unclear where one note ends and another begins, treat consecutive paragraphs as potentially related unless there is a clear topic shift
