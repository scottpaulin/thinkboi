# Clarify Musings

This skill helps users clarify their raw musings through a conversational back-and-forth, preparing them to become professional posts.

## Finding Musings to Clarify

Search for musings that need clarification:

1. Check organized theme sub-pages for musings with status "Raw"
2. Check the main Musings page for any unprocessed content
3. Prioritize musings flagged with "Follow-up Potential"
4. Present a list of candidates and let the user choose, or suggest one to start with

## The Clarification Process

Once a musing is selected, guide the user through clarification by asking questions. Tailor questions to the specific content, but consider:

### Understanding the Core Idea
- What is the main point you want to make?
- Why does this matter to you?
- What prompted this thought?

### Audience and Context
- Who would find this interesting?
- What context does the reader need to understand this?
- Is there a story or example that illustrates this?

### Sharpening the Message
- What do you want the reader to take away?
- Is there a counterpoint or nuance worth addressing?
- How does this connect to your broader thinking or expertise?

Ask one or two questions at a time. Let the user respond via voice or text. Continue until the idea feels clear and ready to structure into a post.

## Storing Clarified Musings

After clarification, update the musing entry in its Notion sub-page.

**IMPORTANT:** Preserve all existing content. Do NOT remove or replace the Original Text. Add new sections below it.

### Updated Entry Format

1. **Summary**: Update if the clarification revealed a sharper focus
2. **Original Text**: Keep preserved, unchanged (never delete this)
3. **Clarification Notes**: Add a new section containing:
   - Key questions asked
   - User responses (summarized or quoted)
   - Core message distilled from the conversation
   - Audience and context notes
   - Any examples or stories surfaced
4. **Date Clarified**: When the clarification happened
5. **Status**: Update to "Clarified"
6. **Follow-up Potential**: Update based on how promising the clarified idea is

## Instructions

1. Use Notion MCP to find musings needing clarification
2. Present options to the user or suggest a starting point
3. Read the selected musing and begin asking clarifying questions
4. Have a conversation, asking follow-up questions based on responses
5. When the idea is clear, summarize the clarified understanding back to the user
6. Update the musing entry in Notion with clarification notes and new status
7. Ask if the user wants to clarify another musing or move to creating a post

## Tips for Good Clarification Questions

- Be specific to the content, not generic
- Ask open-ended questions that encourage elaboration
- If something is unclear, ask for an example
- If the idea is broad, ask what aspect matters most
- If the user seems stuck, offer options or reframe the question
