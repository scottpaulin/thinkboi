# Draft LinkedIn Post

This skill transforms clarified musings into LinkedIn posts formatted for professional engagement.

## Finding Content to Draft

Search for musings ready to become posts:

1. Look for musings with status "Clarified" in theme sub-pages
2. Review the clarification notes for core message, audience, and examples
3. Consider combining related clarified musings if they strengthen each other
4. Let the user choose which musing(s) to work with

## Post Structure

Every LinkedIn post should follow this structure:

### 1. Hook (First 1-3 lines)
The first 150 characters appear before "See more." This determines whether people read further. The hook must create curiosity, tension, or recognition.

### 2. Context (2-4 lines)
Explain why this matters, what prompted the thought, or what is at stake.

### 3. Body (5-10 lines)
Deliver the insight, story, or framework. Use short paragraphs, line breaks, and bullets for readability.

### 4. Call-to-Conversation (1-2 lines)
End with a question that invites others to share their experience, challenge your thinking, or add their perspective. Do not end with a mic drop.

## Post Styles

Choose a style based on the clarified musing content:

### Personal Story
Share a journey, lesson from failure, or moment of insight. Use vulnerability to build connection.
- Start with a surprising or relatable first line
- Structure: What happened, what you learned, what changed
- Works well for: Career lessons, mindset shifts, turning points

### List Format
Organize information into a numbered or bulleted list. Promises clear, digestible insights.
- Put the number in the hook (e.g., "5 things I wish I knew...")
- Keep each point concise and impactful
- Works well for: Tips, mistakes to avoid, frameworks

### Insight/Analysis
Share your perspective on a trend, pattern, or industry observation. Positions you as a thoughtful voice.
- Interpret, do not just report
- Add your unique angle or forward-looking view
- Works well for: Industry commentary, pattern recognition, predictions

### Contrarian Take
Challenge a widely accepted belief. Provokes thought and positions you as an independent thinker.
- Lead with the counterintuitive claim
- Back it up with logic, data, or personal experience
- Works well for: Challenging conventional wisdom, unpopular opinions

## Hook Types

Select a hook approach that fits the content:

- **Provocative statement**: Say something surprising that makes people want to read more
- **Cliffhanger**: Tease an answer or insight, cut off before "See more"
- **Personal revelation**: Share a turning point or challenge from your experience
- **Pattern observation**: "I noticed X happening repeatedly. Here is what it means."
- **Counterintuitive claim**: "Everyone thinks X. They are wrong."
- **Direct value**: "Here is how to do X" or "X things that will help you Y"

## Formatting Guidelines

- Use short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- Add line breaks for whitespace and readability
- Use bullets or numbers for lists
- Aim for 1,000-1,500 characters for standard posts
- Under 300 characters works for quick insights
- Bold or caps sparingly for emphasis
- Include 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end

## Combining Multiple Musings

When related clarified musings can strengthen each other:

1. Identify the common thread or theme
2. Determine which musing provides the core insight
3. Use others as supporting examples, counterpoints, or extensions
4. Maintain a single clear message; do not overload the post

## Instructions

1. Use Notion MCP to find clarified musings
2. Present options and let user select one or more related musings
3. Review clarification notes for core message and audience
4. Suggest a post style and hook approach based on the content
5. Draft the post following the structure above
6. Present the draft to the user for feedback
7. Refine based on feedback until the user is satisfied
8. Store the final draft in the musing entry under "LinkedIn Draft"
9. Update status to "Ready to Post"

## Storage

Add to the musing entry in Notion:

- **LinkedIn Draft**: The formatted post ready for publishing
- **Post Style**: Which style was used
- **Date Drafted**: When the draft was created
- **Status**: Update to "Ready to Post"

After posting, user can update status to "Posted" and optionally add engagement notes.
